    This is a genuine video - but it is misleading
  </h2>
  <p>
This is a genuine video of US Presidential candidate – and well known Trump critic - Joe Biden at a campaign rally apparently supporting Donald Trump.  </p>

 <p>
Although this is actual footage, Joe Biden makes a mistake – which he later corrects but is edited out of the video. </p>
 <p>
“Deep fake” videos, where advanced software is used to generate lifelike videos of people, are now increasingly common. But genuine videos can also be edited to be just as misleading.  </p>
