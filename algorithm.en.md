## The title of explanation goes in markdown

All four items contain false messages that are delivered based on conditions set by an algorithm. 

Facebook's Newsfeed algorithm determines who sees the post.

Google's Page Rank algorithm decides which websites are shown in the search result and in what order. 

Twitter's trending hashtags show which topics are most tweeted about at a given time and place, and this influences which narratives are considered newsworthy.

YouTube's recommendation algorithm suggests videos to us based on topics on which we have already engaged. 

Online platforms use features like hashtags and recommendations to filter the information we are shown. These features are often taken advantage of to present false information in a believable wrapper (such as the first page of Google results or alongside a trending hashtag), or deliver it to the people most likely to believe it (such as someone watching a YouTube video on a related topic or  a Facebook user with certain political opinions).
