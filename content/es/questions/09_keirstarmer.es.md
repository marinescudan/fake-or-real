## This can be considered misninformation

This campaign video was made by the opposing UK Conservative Party to show Labour politician Keir Starmer seemingly unable to answer a simple question about Brexit on a morning news programme.

In the actual interview Keir Stramer answered promptly; the video was edited misleadingly. Increasingly campaigns from all types of political parties are using “cheap fakes”, simple techniques like this one to misrepresent their opponents. 

On social media these campaign videos are often not checked,  and unlike with a newspaper or TV advert, there is rarely any penalty when they are found out.
