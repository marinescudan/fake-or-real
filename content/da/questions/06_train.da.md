### The image in the tweet is real, but way in which it is presented is misleading.

The real image shows a peaceful protest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the murder of Michael Brown on August 9, 2014. Posts like these skew protest narratives, often inciting rage. 
These types of posts  are often shared on social media platforms, where truth and misinformation exists in parallel.
