‘Fake news’ is more than just false information. Even the term ‘fake news’ is misleading, because in many cases it contains some ‘real’ content – a piece of information, video footage or an image – that’s been doctored or taken out of context. 
The term “misinformation” is often used to describe false or misleading content and is shared when the person doesn’t realise that it is false. Misinformation can be anything from a funny meme to a manipulated video; it can spread and become viral especially when it is targeted at people who are likely to believe it. Sometimes, it is placed on a spoof website made to look like a major newspaper, and sometimes it comes straight from the mouth of a politician via social media. 

In Fake or Real Misinformation Edition, dive into this murky world and test your skills at spotting disinformation in its many guises.
