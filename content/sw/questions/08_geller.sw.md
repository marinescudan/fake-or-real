### This story can be considered misinformation!

The video was shared as evidence of so-called ‘migrant crime’ in Italy. But the video actually shows the filming of the 2015 Italian film ‘Mediterranea'. If you look closely, you can see members of the film crew holding up a microphone and a reflector.

The video was posted by anti-immigrant bloggers around the world, and has since been debunked, but it illustrates how easy it is to take video footage and present it out of context with a different headline to lead viewers to believe something other than what is actually shown in the original video.
