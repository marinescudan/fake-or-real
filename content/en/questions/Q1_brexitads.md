### All four of these adverts are suspicious

All of these ads are misleading. 

These adverts all appear to be from different independent groups campaigning for Brexit. 
However, all of these adverts were in fact created and paid for by the company of Lynton Crosby, a well known consultant UK Conservative Party and the Vote leave campaign in the UK. 
The ads were designed to give the impression of a grass roots campaign rather than a well funded centrally managed campaign.

It’s sometimes very hard to see who is really behind adverts, but you can look at Facebook’s political ads directory to see who submitted the ad and paid for them. Search for “Ad library” when you visit facebook.
