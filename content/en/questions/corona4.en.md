## The title of explanation goes in markdown

The news story on blood plasma is genuine.

The autofill feature of Google’s search box shows popular searches and automatically leads people particular topics – in this case that the coronavirus is a bioweapon. This feature encourages people to search for the topic or keyword, in turn boosting its position in search results and making the story seem more likely to be true.

Memes are also effective carriers of misinformation, because they are seen as lighthearted and their humour is often given more importance than their meaning. Plus, they are highly shareable, which means they circulate faster.
