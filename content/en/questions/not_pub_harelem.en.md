## The story is fake.

The WhatsApp video of people crowding a shop was shared among residents of Haarlem in the Netherlands. The video was then shared on TikTok and viewed more than four million times.

Its effect was to spread panic by suggesting that grocery stores were running low on essential supplies. 

Look closely, however, and you can see that this footage is not from the Netherlands at all. The sign to the left in the image is in German, not Dutch. Plus, after noticing the letters in the right of the image, investigators at Bellingcat, who debunked the video, searched for"FBI store" in German and found that FBI is a hairdressing chain in Germany.
