### This video is fake.

The original video of Peolosi’s speech was deceptively edited and spliced together to make it seem like she was stuttering throughout a press conference. Videos like this, which are doctored using basic editing techniques – such as editing them or slowing them down to make someone seem as if they are slurring their words – are called "cheapfakes".
