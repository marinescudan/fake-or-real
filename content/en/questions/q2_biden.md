## This is a genuine video - but it is misleading

This is a genuine video of US Presidential candidate – and well known Trump critic - Joe Biden at a campaign rally apparently supporting Donald Trump.

Although this is actual footage, Joe Biden makes a mistake – which he later corrects but is edited out of the video.

“Deep fake” videos, where advanced software is used to generate lifelike videos of people, are now increasingly common. But genuine videos can also be edited to be just as misleading.
